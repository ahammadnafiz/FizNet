# ZyLearn üöÄ

**Version:** 0.1.0

ZyLearn is an under-development Python library that provides a collection of machine-learning models for various tasks, including classification and beyond. Currently, it features implementations of logistic regression, neural networks, and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifiers. Designed for ease of use, ZyLearn allows researchers and practitioners to quickly experiment with different machine learning techniques.

Note: ZyLearn is still under active development and has not yet been packaged for distribution. Future releases will include more algorithms and features.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Logistic Classifier:** A robust model for binary classification with an easy-to-use API.
- **Neural Network:** Flexible architecture for both simple and complex tasks.
- **KNN Classifier:** Intuitive classification model based on feature similarity.
- **Upcoming Additions:** New algorithms and tools are planned for future versions.

## Getting Started üèÅ

To start using ZyLearn, import and train the desired model on your dataset. Here's a quick example showcasing how to use the available models:

```python
import numpy as np
from ZyLearn.logistic_regression import LogisticClassifier
from ZyLearn.neural_network import NN
from ZyLearn.knn_classifier import KNNClassifier

# Sample data
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=100)
X_test = np.random.rand(20, 10)

# Initialize models
logistic_model = LogisticClassifier()
nn_model = NN(layer_dims=[X_train.shape[1], 10, 5, 2])
knn_model = KNNClassifier()

# Train models
logistic_model.train(X_train, y_train, num_iterations=2500, learning_rate=0.1)
nn_model.train(X_train, y_train, num_iterations=2500, learning_rate=0.1)
knn_model.train(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
logistic_predictions = logistic_model.predict(X_test)
nn_predictions = nn_model.predict(X_test)
knn_predictions = knn_model.predict(X_test)
```

## Available Models üõ†Ô∏è

ZyLearn currently provides the following models for classification tasks:

- **LogisticClassifier**
- **NN (Neural Network)**
- **KNNClassifier**

You can list the available models programmatically:

```python
from ZyLearn import get_available_models

models = get_available_models()
print(models)
```
